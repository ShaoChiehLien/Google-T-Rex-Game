# Google-T-Rex-Game
Introduction: We developed the Google T-Rex Game which could be played using our customized circuit board. The T-Rex could jump accross the cactus or dodge the upcoming crow to keep itself alive. The project could be seperated into three parts, main game program, sound generation and hardware development. In order to display the User Interface, we developed our own library to cooperate with the two screen Graphic LCD (64+64)x64. 
For the main game part, we used our own algorithm to randomly produce three different characters with different distances, which is a significant specialty of this project. By using non-visible simple squares to record characters' position, we could track if the T-Rec touch the cactus or crow and determine if it is Game Over. At last, we added the bit map of each characters on the non-visible simple square to finish the User Interface. 
For the sound generation, we used
